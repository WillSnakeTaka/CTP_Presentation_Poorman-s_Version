# **CTP Presentation Rehearsal😎**

Welcome to our CTP presentation rehearsal page! This project was intended to be a polished HTML page for our presentation, but let's be honest—it was a bit rushed. We were behind schedule, and I ended up editing the second half of the document in the middle of class (classic, right?). We only rehearsed for 5 minutes before class started, but it all came together beautifully in the end. Huge kudos to my teammates, who did an amazing job pulling things together! Also, Hussam, our invisible teamate :V

#**How It Went**

**What happened:** Well, we were a little behind on progress, but we definitely nailed it during the rehearsal.
**What I did:** I wasted way too much time diving into random rabbit holes during class, from machine learning basics to duck studies, to the Tetris documentary. It was all inspired by Hussam’s "Back Then Magic" (you know who you are, Hussam).
Lessons learned: Professionalism is overrated. Sure, I need it for jobs and life, but I will always pursue genuine approaches with wild unstoptable imagination💀. This HTML page, however imperfect, is a tribute to that! 🎨

#**The Art of Chaos 🎭**

This HTML page is a cute, unprofessional artwork for those who know how to laugh about it. It’s not here to impress with fancy designs or flawless code—it's about the journey. Sometimes, when you get stuck in a loop of perfectionism, you forget the joy of experimenting, failing, and laughing your way through it all.

If you’re here to witness the result of a chaotic rehearsal, you’ve come to the right place. If you’re here for clean, well-structured, flawless code… um, this is not that 😅.

#**What’s Inside? 🧐**

HTML Code: Basic structure, a little clunky, but still functioning.
Content: A mix of rushed thoughts, random inspirations, and a bit of Tetris-related wisdom.
Chaos: Pure, unfiltered, raw energy of someone who’s too deep into random topics and too behind on classwork.
**Thanks to:**

My teammates: You both crushed it. Seriously, couldn’t have pulled this off without you.
**Hussam:** For teaching me that github magic and all those accidental inspirations.
**Tetris idea:** For being my unlikely muse during this wild process.(Coming up soon)

#**To Anyone Who Laughs at This 🖤**

This one's for you. If you can see the humor, creativity, and the beauty in the mess, you get it. Don’t take life too seriously, and definitely don’t take Professionalism(Lie about how you wanna change the mother earth though Hussam saved us all) too seriously either.🤡
